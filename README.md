# Additional materials to the thesis project

This page contains information about B16F10 melanoma-associated murine TCRs identified by TCRgrapher following the pipeline described in the thesis.

## Frequency distribution

The folder 'Frequency distribution' contains plots showing distribution of cluster frequency among experimental groups. Every dit correspond to one mouse. Mice from the replicas are present as one boxplot. Clusters were formed by TCRs identified as significant. All clusters had frequency more than 0.25%. Visualisation were made using 'ggplot' R package.

## Motifs
 
The folder 'motifs' contains motifs for all significant clusters with frequency above the threshold. Logo was made by 'ggseqlogo' R package.

File 'Motifs (peptides with 2 groups).pdf' contains tables with comparison of motifs of Th clusters with two experimental groups identified as significant. All clusters had frequency more than 0.25%. p5, p20 and p30 showed strong immune response with a lot of intersections between clusters. Matched clusters highlighted by green. For p17 and p48 one out of two experimental groups showed poor response. However, the most abundant clusters in the groups are the same for both peptides.

## Clonotypes

Table 'clonotypes.tsv' contains information about clonotypes that form significant clusters.
